// format for RandomImages is: [path], [average number of seconds between each image], [side the image starts on], [range of speed], [range of opacity]
// all random images must be on the same line, separated by a "|"
// for starting side, use either "left", "right", or "random".
// for the ranges, provide lower and upper bound -- ex: 5-10 for a number between 5 and 10
// for speed, numbers must be integers; for opacity, numbers must be decimals between 0 and 1
