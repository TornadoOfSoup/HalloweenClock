// all colors are hex color codes, they must be prefixed with a "#"
// for digital clock and schedule, monospaced fonts are recommended
// clock size is the ratio of the size of the clock to the height of the screen, for example, "0.9" is 90% of screen height

// lines can be commented out with "//" which allows you to try new
//   configurations without deleting old ones
// you can also use them to leave yourself notes

// for ScheduleLocation: either TOP, BOTTOM, or CENTER

// remove or comment out lines you want to be set to defaults

// format for RandomImages is: [path], [average number of seconds between each image], [side the image starts on], [range of speed], [range of opacity]
// all random images must be on the same line, separated by a "|"
// for starting side, use either "left", "right", or "random".
// for the ranges, provide lower and upper bound -- ex: 5-10 for a number between 5 and 10
// for speed, numbers must be integers; for opacity, numbers must be decimals between 0 and 1
